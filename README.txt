----------
Gmail account awklang@gmail.com created by Panos Papadopoulos.
Panos asked Berry <karl@freefriends.org> to forward:

	info@awklang.org --> awklang@gmail.com

2017-12-25
----------
Karl said that it's better to use awklang@awklang.org instead of
info@awklang.org to avoid spam.

2017-12-26
----------
Karl redirected awklang@awklang.org to awklang@gmail.com and Panos
forwarded awklang@gmail.com to his personal email account panos1962@gmail.com

	awklang@gmail.com --> panos1962@gmail.com

Panos asked Arnold Robbins to receive CCs.

2017-12-27
----------
Arnold refused to get CCs from awklang@gmail.com, so now only Panos
get email messages.
